# ptpchat

*A very simple peer to peer chat program, designed to keep communication secure.*

This is mainly a test project, to better understand peer to peer processes and secure communication. If all goes well it could also be a viable chat program. It is currently only a windows c# program (possibly mono compatible).

There are two projects involved, this **ptpchat** project, and the **ptpchat-server** project, an assistant server program to broker communication between natted devices.
